I have a passion for **writing**, **SEO**, and **UI/UX**.
- **Writing** leads me to content and copywriting.
- **SEO** leads me to programmatic SEO.
- **UI/UX** leads me to React templates.

</br>

So, I have combined all the above skills with my core skill (web development) and building mini products.
</br>

1. I have built dozens of UIs from scratch using React.js.

2. My portfolio showcases my UI skills: [https://basit.sh](https://basit.sh)

3. If you want to check out my recent work, you can find it at [https://www.flexyui.com](https://www.flexyui.com) (still in the development phase).

</br>

I have also explored programmatic SEO and built [https://mobiles360.pk/](https://mobiles360.pk/) with a Twitter friend. It has over 7,000 pages indexed on Google in the last 6 months and received 68K visitors in the last 28 days, according to the Search Console report.

</br>

To polish my copywriting skills, I run a technical newsletter that has more than 200 subscribers (and growing).
